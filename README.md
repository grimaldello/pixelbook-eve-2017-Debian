# Pixelbook EVE 2017 - Debian
In a fresh Debian installation, almost everthing is working out of the box.
With the exception of a few features which are very nice to have working.

This repository contains some post-install configurations and guides in order to make working:

- Audio
- Screen brightness
- udev stuff (keyboard mappings db and backlight rules)

on a new Debian KDE Plasma installation (tested only on KDE Plasma).

The goal is to keep the guides simple and direct to the point, no explanation is provided for commands.

For a complete guide or better explanations, you can check out [jmontleon - pixelbook-fedora](https://github.com/jmontleon/pixelbook-fedora)

# How to use 
In each folder of the repository, is present a guide (file README.md).
Some guides only need to run some commands from the terminal, others may also need to copy files on your system.
For this reason, I suggest to clone (or to download) the repository.
